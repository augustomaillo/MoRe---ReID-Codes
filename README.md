<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Motorcycles are abundant objects in the transit and often related with traffic and criminal law breaking in many countries. For instance, motorcycles are used to perform rob-and-run crimes and related to an increasing number of accidents that result in severe injuries and deaths. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the motorcycles and monitor its behavior in wide areas, which is an overwhelming work.

Moreover, Motorcycle ReID has some remarkable differences when compared to the classical ReID problems as person and vehicle.

To address the above-mentioned issues and boost the research in the motorcycle ReID problem, we propose the *Mo*torcycle *Re*-Identification (MoRe) dataset, which is the first large-scale motorcycle ReID database captured by urban traffic cameras.

This repository contains all codes used for evaluating ReID task on MoRe Dataset.
